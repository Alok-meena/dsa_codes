What is Greedy Algorithm?
A greedy algorithm is a type of optimization algorithm that makes locally optimal choices at each step to find a globally optimal solution.
It operates on the principle of “taking the best option now” without considering the long-term consequences.

Steps for Creating a Greedy Algorithm
The steps to define a greedy algorithm are:

Define the problem: Clearly state the problem to be solved and the objective to be optimized.
Identify the greedy choice: Determine the locally optimal choice at each step based on the current state.
Make the greedy choice: Select the greedy choice and update the current state.
Repeat: Continue making greedy choices until a solution is reached.

  Applications of Greedy Algorithm
There are many applications of the greedy method in DAA. Some important greedy algorithm applications are:

Assigning tasks to resources to minimize waiting time or maximize efficiency.
Selecting the most valuable items to fit into a knapsack with limited capacity.
Dividing an image into regions with similar characteristics.
Reducing the size of data by removing redundant information.
Disadvantages/Limitations of Using a Greedy Algorithm
Below are some disadvantages of the Greedy Algorithm:

Greedy algorithms may not always find the best possible solution.
The order in which the elements are considered can significantly impact the outcome.
Greedy algorithms focus on local optimizations and may miss better solutions that require considering a broader context.
Greedy algorithms are not applicable to problems where the greedy choice does not lead to an optimal solution.
