basically the classes we create takes space in stack 
while if we dont it dynamically using new keyword and pointers then it takes space in heap


In the given code, the object `d1` of the `dog` class is created inside the `main` function, so it will be **stored on the stack**.

### Why Stack?

- **Automatic Storage Duration:** In C++, local variables (like `d1` in your `main` function) have automatic storage duration, meaning they are automatically created when the function is called and destroyed when the function returns. These objects are typically stored on the **stack**.
  
- **Lifetime:** The object `d1` will be created when the program enters the `main` function and will be destroyed when the `main` function exits.

### If You Used `new` (Heap Allocation)

If you dynamically allocated the `dog` object using `new`, then it would be stored on the **heap** instead of the stack:

```cpp
dog* d1 = new dog();
d1->print();
delete d1; // Remember to free the memory
```

In this case, `d1` is a pointer, and the memory for the object is allocated on the heap. You must manually `delete` the object to free the memory when you're done using it.

### Stack vs Heap
- **Stack:**
  - Memory is automatically managed.
  - Limited size (typically much smaller than heap).
  - Faster allocation and deallocation.
  - The object is destroyed automatically when it goes out of scope.
  
- **Heap:**
  - Memory must be manually managed using `new` and `delete`.
  - Larger size.
  - Slower allocation and deallocation.
  - Objects remain in memory until explicitly deleted.

### Conclusion
In your code, since you are declaring the `dog` object `d1` without `new`, it will be stored on the **stack**.








No, **stack allocation** and **static allocation** do **not** take space in the same memory region. They are distinct in terms of where they are stored in memory. Let me clarify:

---

### **1. Static Allocation**
- **Memory Location:** Static allocation happens in the **data segment** of the program's memory, not in the stack.
  - Specifically, static variables are stored in either the **initialized data segment** or the **BSS segment** (for uninitialized static variables).
- **Lifetime:** Static variables exist for the entire duration of the program.
- **Scope:** They can be global or local (if declared `static` inside a function), but their memory location is always in the **data segment**, not the stack.

---

### **2. Stack Allocation**
- **Memory Location:** Stack allocation happens in the **stack memory**.
  - The stack is a region of memory that grows and shrinks with function calls and returns.
- **Lifetime:** Variables allocated on the stack exist only within the scope of the function or block in which they are defined.
- **Scope:** Limited to the function or block where the variable is declared.

---

### **Key Difference**
The **stack** and the **data segment** are separate regions in memory:

1. **Stack:**
   - Used for local variables (non-static) and function call information.
   - Grows and shrinks dynamically during program execution.
   - Memory is deallocated automatically when the function or block scope ends.

2. **Data Segment (Static Allocation):**
   - Used for global variables, static variables, and constants.
   - Does not grow or shrink dynamically.
   - Memory persists for the lifetime of the program.

---

### **Example for Clarity**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Static allocation (global scope)
int globalVar = 10;  // Stored in data segment

void func() {
    static int staticVar = 20;  // Stored in data segment
    int localVar = 30;          // Stored in stack

    cout << "Static Var: " << staticVar << ", Local Var: " << localVar << endl;
}

int main() {
    func(); // First call
    func(); // Second call
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Static Var: 20, Local Var: 30
Static Var: 20, Local Var: 30
```

### **Memory Breakdown**
| Variable      | Memory Region         | Reason                       |
|---------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| `globalVar`   | Data Segment          | Global variable (static allocation). |
| `staticVar`   | Data Segment          | Static variable inside a function.   |
| `localVar`    | Stack                 | Local variable (automatic allocation). |

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Static allocation does not take space in the stack.** It uses the **data segment**.
- **Stack allocation is separate** and is used for local variables and function call data.









Used to Avoid Naming Conflicts:

When a parameter has the same name as a class member, this helps distinguish between them.
cpp
Copy code
void set_age(int age) {
    this->age = age; // Resolves the conflict between parameter and member
}
