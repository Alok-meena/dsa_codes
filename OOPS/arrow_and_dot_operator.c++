The choice between the **dot operator (`.`)** and the **arrow operator (`->`)** in C++ depends on whether you're working with an object directly or through a pointer. Here's how they differ and why you typically see the **arrow operator** used in linked lists:

---

### **Dot Operator (`.`)**
- **Used when you have a direct object.**
- Accesses members (attributes or methods) of an object directly.
  
#### Example:
```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    void display() {
        cout << "Data: " << data << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Node node; // Direct object
    node.data = 10; // Use dot operator
    node.display(); // Use dot operator
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Arrow Operator (`->`)**
- **Used when you have a pointer to an object.**
- Dereferences the pointer and accesses the member of the object it points to.

#### Example:
```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    void display() {
        cout << "Data: " << data << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Node* node = new Node(); // Pointer to an object
    node->data = 10; // Use arrow operator
    node->display(); // Use arrow operator
    delete node; // Free allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Why Use the Arrow Operator in Linked Lists?**
In linked lists, nodes are typically dynamically allocated using `new` and are connected through pointers. This means you're working with **pointers to objects**, not the objects themselves. As a result, you use the **arrow operator (`->`)** to access the members of the nodes.

#### Example of a Linked List:
```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

int main() {
    Node* head = new Node(); // Dynamically allocate the first node
    head->data = 1;
    head->next = new Node(); // Dynamically allocate the second node
    head->next->data = 2;
    head->next->next = nullptr;

    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != nullptr) {
        cout << temp->data << " "; // Use arrow operator
        temp = temp->next; // Move to the next node
    }

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Key Difference:
- **Dot Operator (`.`)**: For objects directly (on the stack).
- **Arrow Operator (`->`)**: For pointers to objects (on the heap or stack).

---

### Practical Observation:
In **object-oriented programming**, when you're dealing with objects stored on the stack, you'll use the **dot operator** most of the time. 

In **linked lists** or other dynamic data structures where objects are allocated on the heap and managed via pointers, you'll use the **arrow operator**.
