if removing a vertex and its related edges causes the graph to become disconnected,
the vertex is considered to be an articulation point in the graph.
Therefore, the number of related components in a graph grows as articulation points are removed.
A connected component, or simply component, is a subgraph where every pair of nodes is connected to every other node by a path.
